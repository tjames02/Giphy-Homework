Giphy API Homework
This website uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of animals depending on which button the user presses.  

When the user clicks on a gif, it animates, and when the user clicks again, it stops. 

The user can also create a new button for a different topic, and can then click on the button to generate gifs on that topic. 

The website calls GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
